!DNS application inspection utilizes the 
!Modular Policy Framework (MPF) for configuration.! 
!To configure application inspection, administrators may construct! 
!an inspection policy through the configuration of inspect class maps 
!and inspect policy maps, which are applied via a global 
!or an interface service policy. 
!The following example demonstrates configuration of this feature.

** CONFIG **
!
class-map inspection_default
match default-inspection-traffic
!
policy-map type inspect dns preset_dns_map
parameters
!
!– Enable dns-guard to verify that DNS query and response transaction IDs match and only one ! DNS response is allowed through the firewall for each query.
!
dns-guard
!
!– Enable id-randomization to generate unpredictable DNS transaction IDs in !DNS messages and protect DNS servers and resolvers with poor randomization of !DNS transaction IDs.
!
id-randomization
!
!– Enable a maximum message length to help defeat DNS amplification attacks. Note: This is the ! default configuration and value based on RFC 1035.
!
message-length maximum 512
!
!– Enable id-mismatch to count DNS transaction ID mismatches within a specified period of time !and generate a syslog when the defined threshold has been reached.
!
id-mismatch count 10 duration 2 action log
exit
!
!– Check for DNS query messages with the recursion desired (RD) flag set in the DNS header !and drop those packets to avoid being used as a recursive resolver.

!DNS Service Policy Identification
!When the DNS guard, DNS ID randomization, DNS ID mismatch, 
!and DNS protocol enforcement functions 
!for the DNS application inspection feature are enabled, 
!the *show service-policy inspect* 
!command will identify the number of DNS packets inspected or dropped! 
!by these functions and this feature. 
!Example output for show service-policy inspect dns follows

!– Output for service-policy applied globally
!

Syslog Identification

In the following example, the show logging | grep regex command extracts syslog messages from the logging buffer on the firewall. These messages provide additional information about denied packets. It is possible to use different regular expressions with the grep keyword to search for specific data in the logged messages.

Firewall syslog message 410002 will be generated when the firewall detects a high rate of DNS responses with a mismatched DNS transaction ID. The threshold for this function is set by the id-mismatch parameters submode command for policy-map type inspect dns. Additional information about this syslog message is available in Cisco Security Appliance System Log Message - 410002.

Firewall syslog message 106007 will be generated when the firewall detects that a DNS response message has already been received for a DNS query message and the connection entry has been torn down by the DNS guard function. This syslog message indicates that the DNS response message received has been denied. Additional information about this syslog message is available in Cisco Security Appliance System Log Message - 106007.

Additional information about regular expression syntax is available in Using the Command Line Interface.
