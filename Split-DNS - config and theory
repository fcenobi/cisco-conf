#!Cisco Split DNS - router config

The Split DNS feature enables a Cisco router to respond to Domain Name System (DNS) queries.
In a Split DNS environment, multiple DNS databases can be configured on the router. 



ip domain lookup
    ip domain timeout 2
    ip domain name office.local
    ip name-server 8.8.8.8
    ip name-server 8.8.4.4
    ip dns server
!
    ip dns view no_dns_service_view
     no domain lookup	
     no dns forwarding
!
    ip dns view default
     domain timeout 2
     dns forwarder 8.8.8.8
!
    ip dns view-list no_dns_service_list
     view no_dns_service_view 1
!
    interface fa0/0
     ip dns view-group no_dns_service_list
 !    
  !   
   
   
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   1. configure the default DNS -- Use i.e.: Google DNS + Cloudflare

ip name-server 8.8.8.8
ip name-server 1.1.1.1

  2. configure DNS views -- determine which DNS resolvers it forwards. 
  Let's build a 2 views - one pointing to Unblock-US and second we use for all other requests 
  >> adjust the DNS view to suits you and yours environment.

ip dns view default
 dns forwarder 8.8.8.8
 dns forwarder 1.1.1.1
ip dns view unblockus
 dns forwarder 111.118.175.56
 dns forwarder 118.127.33.48


3. Domains that you want to use with your non-default DNS view. 
i.e.: let's forward Netflix to Unblock-US : 

ip dns name-list 1 permit .*.NETFLIX.COM
ip dns name-list 1 permit .*.UNBLOCK-US.COM
ip dns name-list 1 permit .*.US-WEST-9.ELB.AMAZONAWS.COM

>> extra DNS views needs an extra DNS name-lists with a raising ID.

4. DNS view-list >> forwards requests based on the name list. 
Anything that doesnâ€™t match a name list is forwarded to the default.

ip dns view-list primary
 view unblockus 10
  restrict name-group 1
 view default 100

5. Last config needed is to set router to use the view-list defined above 
and activating the DNS service.

ip dns server view-group primary
ip dns server

Adjust to suit as needed >> and you have a split DNS!!
