# Structured approach to Implementation 

## Planning & Execution

– The network engineering team identifies the need for a network upgrade
> *Planning is the first step*

### **Methodologies / Templates**
* The Cisco Lifecycle Services 
* IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL)
* The Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security  (FCAPS) model
* The Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) model

> After all the requirements, models, and tools have been defined and collected >> the implementation plan can be created.

### **Creating an Implementation Plan (based on PPDIOO model)**

1.  Identify customer requirements.
2.  Characterize the existing network, sites, devices & technologies ( Existing environment)
3.  Design the new network topology and solutions

### **Implementation process is executed**

1. Plan the implementation
2. Implement and verify the design
3. Monitor and optionally Redesign (Request for Changes / CRF)

## **Before implementing**

Collect together all the information about your network such as: 
- IP Addresses + subnets
- Network Blueprints
- Contacts
- Photos (if applicable)
- Serial Numbers / Contracts / Ownership 
- Software Versions & Revisions installed
- Additional Hardware
- Network dependencies
- Critical Infrastructure Points

### **Dependencies**
- activities / servicies that might get affected by a *failed implementation*
- people responsible for devices & people who are going to perform the implementation changes
- Time Schedules and Time Tables / Timeline with Short Description of the steps
- Contact Information - together with Implementation Plan Order list 
> During the executing and applying phases will all the information come in handy ;)
> The following steps are **completed** during Creation and Execution of an Implementation Plan

- Planning the implementation 
  - Do not forget to include a testing phase! 
  - During the above and after a below step test your plan!
  
- Selecting the tools and resources required
- Co-ordinating work with specialists and other people involved
- Verifying the implementation 
- Measuring and Interpreting performance results
  - Graphical Tools may be handy - still all need CLI inputs
- Documenting the baseline, performance, and recommendations

### **Site-specific Tasks** 
> Implementation plan may include the following steps

• Identifying applications and devices to be implemented
• Creating installation tasks and checklists
• Defining device configuration and software requirements
• Creating site-specific device configurations, installation tasks, and checklists
• Creating installation verification tests


# Create & Follow the Implementation Plan
## Basic Planning Phases

### **Phase 1 : Necessary Information / Data**

[ ] Accurate Network Diagram
[ ] IP Address Diagram / Spreadsheet
[ ] Configuration Commands
[ ] Hardware Required
[ ] Equipment List
[ ] Link Utilization
[ ] Timeline
[ ] Relevant Contact information (Cisco TAC, LCON/LPOC, Consultants, NOC, COE, Specialists ...)

### **Phase 2: Implementation Plan**
[ ] Identify devices and tasks (check list)
[ ] List necessary software version
[ ] List configuration
[ ] Verification and testing

### **Phase 3: Documentation**

[ ] Network diagram/ information
[ ] Network Equipment
[ ] Current configurations
[ ] Known issues
[ ] Network performance baseline
[ ] Verification commands and results
[ ] Monitoring and management utilities
[ ] Photograps and Screencaps

[x] Documentation must become who you are
[x] Documentation is a depreciating asset
[x] Use a checklist to verify all steps had been done
