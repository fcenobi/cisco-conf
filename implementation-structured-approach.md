# Structured approach to Implementation 
## Planning & Execution

– The network engineering team identifies the need for a network upgrade
> *Planning is the first step*

**Methodologies / Templates**
 –The Cisco Lifecycle Services 
 –IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL)
 – The Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security  (FCAPS) model
 – The Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) model

After all the requirements, models, and tools have been defined and collected >> the implementation plan can be created.

**Creating an Implementation Plan (based on PPDIOO model)**

Step 1. Identify customer requirements.
Step 2.  Characterize the existing network and sites. ( Existing environment)
Step 3.  Design the network topology and solutions.

**Implementation process is executed**

Step 1. Plan the implementation
Step 2. Implement and verify the design
Step 3. Monitor and optionally redesign (request for changes)

**Before implementing:**
> important
- collect together all the information about your network ( such as: IP Addresses + subnets, Network Blueprints, 

*Dependencies*
- activities / servicies that might be affected from a bad implementation
- people who will perform the implementation steps
- schedules and time tables
- contact information - together with Implementation Plan order list -- during executing all the information in handy.

The following steps are **completed** during creation and execution of an implementation plan:
• Planning the implementation
• Selecting the tools and resources required
• Coordinating work with specialists
• Verifying the implementation
• Interpreting performance results
• Documenting the baseline, performance, and recommendations

**Site-specific Tasks** in implementation plan may include the following:
• Identifying applications and devices to be implemented
• Creating installation tasks and checklists
• Defining device configuration and software requirements
• Creating site-specific device configurations, installation tasks, and checklists
• Creating installation verification tests


# Create & Follow the Implementation Plan

## Basic Planning Phases

### **Phase 1 : Necessary Information / Data**

[] Accurate Network Diagram
[] IP Address Diagram / Spreadsheet
[] Configuration Commands
[] Hardware Required
[] Equipment List
[] Link Utilization
[] Timeline
[] Relevant Contact information (Cisco TAC, LCON/LPOC, Consultants, NOC, COE, Specialists ...)

### **Phase 2: Implementation Plan**
[] Identify devices and tasks (check list)
[] List necessary software version
[] List configuration
[] Verification and testing

### **Phase 3: Documentation**

[] Network diagram/ information
[] Network Equipment
[] Current configurations
[] Known issues
[] Network performance baseline
[] Verification commands and results
[] Monitoring and management utilities
[] Photograps and Screencaps

[] Documentation must become who you are
[] Documentation is a depreciating asset
