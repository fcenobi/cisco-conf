# Structured approach to Implementation

## Planning & Execution

â€“ The network engineering team identifies the need for a network upgrade
> *Planning is the first step*

### **Methodologies / Templates**
* The Cisco Lifecycle Services
* IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL)
* The Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security  (FCAPS) model
* The Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) model

> After all the requirements, models, and tools have been defined and collected
> the implementation plan can be created.

### **Creating an Implementation Plan (based on PPDIOO model)**

1.  Identify customer requirements.
2.  Characterize the existing network, sites, devices & technologies ( Existing environment)
3.  Design the new network topology and solutions

### **Implementation process is executed**

1. Plan the implementation
2. Implement and verify the design
3. Monitor and optionally Redesign (Request for Changes / CRF)

## **Before implementing**

Collect together all the information about your network such as:
- IP Addresses + subnets
- Network Blueprints
- Contacts
- Photos (if applicable)
- Serial Numbers / Contracts / Ownership
- Software Versions & Revisions installed
- Additional Hardware
- Network dependencies
- Critical Infrastructure Points

### **Dependencies**
- activities / services that might get affected in a case of *Failed Scheduled Implementation*
- people responsible for devices & people who are going to perform the implementation changes
- Time Schedules and Time Tables 
  - Timeline with Short Description of the steps
- Contact Information 
  - Always list Contact Details in more places 
  - together with Implementation Plan Tasks Overview
  - add them in Task Details as well
  - all the information will come in handy and always needed quickly ;)
> The following steps are **completed** during Creation and Execution of an Implementation Plan

- Planning the implementation
- Do not forget to include a testing phase!
- During the above and after a below step test your plan!

- Selecting the tools and resources required
- Co-ordinating work with specialists and other people involved
- Verifying the implementation
- Measuring and Interpreting performance results
- Graphical Tools may be handy -- still all apps need CLI Raw data-inputs
- Documenting the baseline, performance, and recommendations

### **Site-specific Tasks**
> Implementation plan may include the following steps, but always consider per-case

* Identifying applications and devices to be implemented
* Creating installation tasks and checklists
* Defining device configuration and software requirements
* Creating site-specific device configurations, installation tasks, and checklists
* Creating installation verification tests
